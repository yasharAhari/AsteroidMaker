# Asteroid_Maker_processing

The asteroid maker creates randomly generated asteroids using meshes. In this repo, I am using the Java Processing to develop the code for generating since it is easier for visualization and since it is in java, it is much easier to transfer it to C-sharp in Unity. Please see the Wiki page for more details.
